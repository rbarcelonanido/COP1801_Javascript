**Program Overview**
This simple web-based application prompts the user for their first name and favorite number.
Utilinzing the favorite number as the radius, the program calculates the area of a circle and presents the result in a friendly message to the user.

**Features**
- User Interaction: Through prompt dialogs, the program collects user input for personalization and calculations.
- Mathematical Calculation: Demonstrates the practical use of mathematics in programming by calculating the area of a circle based on the user's input.
- Result Presentation: Outputs a personalized message directly on the webpage using the 'document.write()' method, showcasing the calculated area of a circle.


**How It Works**
_Collecting User Information_
- The program first asks for the user's first name to personalize the interaction.
- It then requests the user's favorite number, which will be used as the radius of a circle for subsequent calculations.

_Mathematical Operations_
- The constant 'pi' is defined using 'Math.PI'  to represent the mathematical constant π.
- The area of a circle is calculated using the formula πr², where r is the radius provided by the user's favorite number.

_Displaying Result_
- The program constructs a personalized message incorporating the user's name, their favorite number, and the calculated area of the circle.
- This message is then displayed on the webpage using 'document.write();, formatted within a paragraph tag for better readability.


**Technologies Used**
_JavaScript_
- The entire program is written in JavaScript, leveraging built-in ovjects like 'Math' for calculations and 'document' for displaying result.

**Running the Program**
- To run this program, simply include the provided JavaScript code in an HTML file within a '<script>' tag. Open the HTML file in a web browser to interact with the application.
